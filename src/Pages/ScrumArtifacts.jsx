            <p>There are a couple of scrum artifacts, but we will only focus on three of the main ones - which are:</p>
            <p>Product Backlog - the product backlog contains all the features (in the form of user stories) which the scrum team needs to implement to finish and maintain the product.</p>
            <p>Sprint Backlog - the sprint backlog contains a selected amount of features from the product backlog which the scrum team work on during a specific sprint (an iteration).</p>
            <p>Burn chart - the burn chart is a graphic which illustrates how fast the scrum team are completing the different features (user stories) during a sprint. This is used to keep track of the pace.</p>
            <p>Next we recommend you to read about Sprint Review.</p>
