            <p>The sprint planning is a meeting where the scrum team estimates the work time required to complete each user story, and:</p>
            <p>decides for how long the sprint will continue - usually 1-3 weeks -, and:</p>
            <p>the scrum master and team decides what to include on the sprint backlog and thus determine what they will be working on for the remainder of the sprint.</p>
