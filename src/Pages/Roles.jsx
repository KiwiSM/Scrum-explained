            <h1>Different Roles</h1>
            <p>There are a couple of different roles to keep in mind of when working with scrum.</p>
            <p>The most essential roles are those of the:</p>
            <p>Product owner - represents and acts customer. The product owner decides "what" is desired and "why" it is desired.</p>
            <p>Scrum master - a certified team leader of a scrum team. Keeps an eye on the process and ensures that everyone complies with it. You could describe the scrum master as a "process facilitator".</p>
            <p>Scrum team - the team consists of 3-6 persons whose job it is to implement the features in the backlog and thus develop the product. In this team we find designers, developers and content creators. They decide "how" and "how quickly" work is delivered.</p>
