            <h1>Agile estimation</h1>
            <p>With the help of agile estimation we are able to determine the importance of different user stories, i.e. the order of the list of features in the backlog - the estimation is a qualified iterative guess.</p>
            <p>It is hard to estimate the amount of work required for Epics - so try to avoid those as user stories.</p>
            <p>Traditional estimations usually go by the number of lines of code and function points, while agile estimation looks at ideal days and story points.</p>
            <p>An ideal day is a day where all you do is work with the feature. You have all you need, and you're never disrupted.</p>
            <p>Story points are used to give user stories different scores, and thus determine the order of the backlog.</p>
            <p>Once we have ordered the backlog, the first sprint begins.</p>
            <p>Next we recommend you to read about Sprint</p>
