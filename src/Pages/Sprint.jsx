            <p>A sprint contains a couple of the other different concepts which we explain in more detail on their respective pages, but briefly put a sprint contains sprint planning, a sprint backlog, the sprint, a sprint review and a sprint retrospect.</p> 
            <p>Once all these sub sections are done we have completed a sprint, and may start our next sprint - and thus we iterate from sprint to sprint until we have a finished product</p>
            <p>We recommend you to read about Sprint Planning next</p>
