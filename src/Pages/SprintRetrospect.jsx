            <p>At the end of each sprint we have a final meeting, the sprint restropect, where the scrum team and everyone involved discuss what has worked well and what has worked less well.</p>
            <p>The meeting is usually very short, approximately 15-30 minutes, and everyone takes turn in answer three questions:</p>
            <p> - What do I want to start doing?</p>
            <p> - What will I stop doing?</p>
            <p> - What will I continue to do?</p>
            <p>These three questions helps the people involved to identify good and bad practices, and do more of the former and less of the latter.</p>
