            <p>This is where it all starts.</p>
            <p>The backlog is one of the scrum artifacts and contains a list of features to be developed, usually in the form of "user stories" - user stories are short descriptions of experiences and needs.</p>
            <p>The features in the backlog have to be completed if the product is to be completed and maintained. It is managed by the product owner.</p>
            <p>The scrum team estimates roughly how much work has to be put into each feature. The estimation is usually in the form of a scale from 1-3, where 3 is "very tough".</p>
            <p>The features in the backlog are ranked depending on importance to the project. The project is the summary of all features.</p>
            <p>Next we recommend you to read about the different roles.</p>
